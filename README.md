- 👋 Hi, I’m @f1rkb
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to automatically scrape articles from a website, import into CHAT GPT for rewording then deploy to another website - all automatically
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do this, but I'm completely new to this all, no coding backround at all.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the following functions: automatically scrape articles from a website; import scraped data into CHAT GPT for rewording and reimaging; atuomating the deployment of reworded/reimaged content to another website. I am also interested in how to get chat gpt to combine and rport on a word document and a seperate but related excel file too.
